    <h1 class="text-title">About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an urban and regional planner and researcher with a passion for understanding and addressing informality in human settlements, transport systems, urban economics, and the impacts of climate change. I also specialize in Python programming and GIS spatial data science, using these skills to analyze and model urban dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a focus on creating more sustainable and equitable cities, I explore how informal practices and systems shape urban life. My work involves using data science, spatial analysis, and research to better understand the challenges and opportunities in urban and regional planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are some of my key areas of interest:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Informality in human settlements</li>
      <li>Urban transport systems and mobility</li>
      <li>Urban economics and policy analysis</li>
      <li>Climate change adaptation in cities</li>
      <li>Python and GIS-based spatial data science</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I am passionate about using data and research to inform better decision-making for urban development, policy, and planning. My approach blends technical skills in spatial analysis with a deep understanding of social, economic, and environmental contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and urbanism, as well as sharing insights through my blog and research papers.
